# Multiplayer Chess Board Game

Welcome to the **Multiplayer Chess Board Game** repository! This project is a web-based chess game designed for two players. It combines a modern tech stack, including **Node.js**, **React.js**, **WebSockets**, and **CORS**, to create a seamless, interactive experience for users.

## Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay**: Engage in real-time chess matches with another player using WebSockets for instant communication.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for all screen sizes.
- **Secure Connections**: The game utilizes CORS to ensure secure and controlled connections between the frontend and backend.
- **Interactive Chessboard**: A fully functional chessboard where players can make moves, capture pieces, and follow the rules of chess.
- **Efficient Backend**: Powered by Node.js, the backend efficiently handles game logic, player interactions, and data management.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js**: The backend is developed using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows for efficient handling of asynchronous events, making it ideal for real-time applications like multiplayer games.

- **WebSockets**: WebSockets are used to establish a full-duplex communication channel between the server and clients, enabling real-time interaction and ensuring that both players see the moves on the chessboard instantaneously.

- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is implemented to manage the interaction between the frontend and backend, allowing the React frontend to securely communicate with the Node.js backend.

### Frontend

- **React.js**: The frontend is built with React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture allows for the efficient rendering of the chessboard and its pieces.

- **Responsive UI**: The chessboard and game interface are designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience whether you're playing on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the Multiplayer Chess Board Game, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

- **npm or yarn**: You'll need a package manager like npm or yarn to install dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiplayer-chess-game.git
    cd multiplayer-chess-game
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm start
    ```

5. **Start the frontend server**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

6. **Access the game**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start playing.

## How to Play

1. **Join the Game**: Two players can join the game. The first player to connect will be assigned the white pieces, and the second player will control the black pieces.

2. **Make Your Moves**: Players take turns to move their pieces according to the rules of chess. The game will automatically update the board in real-time for both players.

3. **Win the Game**: Checkmate your opponent to win the game!
